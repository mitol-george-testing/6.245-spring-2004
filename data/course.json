  "course_title": "Multivariable Control Systems",
  "course_description": "This course uses computer-aided design methodologies for synthesis of multivariable feedback control systems. Topics covered include: performance and robustness trade-offs; model-based compensators; Q-parameterization; ill-posed optimization problems; dynamic augmentation; linear-quadratic optimization of controllers; H-infinity controller design; Mu-synthesis; model and compensator simplification; and nonlinear effects. The assignments for the course comprise of computer-aided (MATLAB\u00ae) design problems.\n",
